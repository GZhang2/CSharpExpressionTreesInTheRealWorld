What are expression trees?

- We know what lambda functions are
    - Fancy looking functions
    - Shorthand
    - Very convenient

- Main difference
    - A lambda does the action
    - Expression trees describe the lambda that does the action

Using a function that converts a string to upper case as an example

- Func<string, string> vs Expression<Func<string, string>>
    - Func does the thing
    - Expression trees are the breakdown of what that function does

- ExpressionVisitor

- Real world examples
    - Entity Framework - translating queries to SQL
    - AutoMapper - selecting properties from an object
    - SqlModelMapper - generating insert/update SQL statements
    - Order by method
    - Rolling your own functions
        - Performance
    - Rules engine - create your own query language!

- Weaknesses
    - Cooking Expressions don't always work like you think they should
    - Concatenating strings
